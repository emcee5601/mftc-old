This repo deploys [old versions](https://github.com/emcee5601/fit-test-console/tags) of [fit-test-console](https://github.com/emcee5601/fit-test-console) to [Github Pages](https://emcee5601.github.io/mftc-old/) using [Actions](https://github.com/emcee5601/mftc-old/actions) on a nightly basis.

Since the old versions are deployed to the same origin as https://emcee5601.github.io/fit-test-console/ there may be some [unexpected behavior](https://web.dev/articles/building-multiple-pwas-on-the-same-domain).

To deploy a single user-specified version of fit-test-console, see this [older version](https://github.com/emcee5601/mftc-old/blob/0a1291311bd362162a8e527cc58b5a32e02eacc6/README.md) of this document for instructions. Be sure to use an older version of this repo if you intend to do that to avoid automagically deploying multiple versions daily.

todo: prune very old versions
