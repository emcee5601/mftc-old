This repo deploys old versions of https://github.com/emcee5601/fit-test-console to Github Pages.

This repo deploys to https://emcee5601.github.io/mftc-old/

Since this is the same origin as https://emcee5601.github.io/fit-test-console/ there may be some [unexpected behavior](https://web.dev/articles/building-multiple-pwas-on-the-same-domain).

The last few versions will be deployed automagically on a nightly basis.

This repo can also deploy a single user-specified version of fit-test-console. See this [older version](https://github.com/emcee5601/mftc-old/blob/0a1291311bd362162a8e527cc58b5a32e02eacc6/README.md) of this document for instructions. Be sure to use an older version of this repo if you intend to do that to avoid automagically deploying multiple versions daily.
